Builder Pattern, let  you build complex object step by step. using only those step you really need.

Use the Builder pattern to get rid of a “telescoping constructor”.
 == let's say you constructor with 10 optional parameter, and you want 3 and 4 parm object. then you have to create costructor with possible param, so number 
 == of constructor will be huge.
